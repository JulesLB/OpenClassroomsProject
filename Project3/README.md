# Project 3: Introduction to data analysis and machine learning
***
The French Healthcare institute launched an open innovation context in order to develop innovating app regarding the food industry.
To do so, we are given the following data set, which give information regarding 1M food product.  

The objective of my project is to determine whether it is possible to predict the nutriscore of a product. The nutriscore determines the quality of a product by giving a score from a to e.
It was asked to split the notebook in two parts with:
- a notebook dedicated to the data analysis
- a notebook dedicated to the nutriscore prediction

The dataset is available here:
