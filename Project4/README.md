# Project 4: Optimization of Supervised Algorithm
***
This project's goal is to predict the CO2 emission and Electricity consumption of buildings in Seattle based on the building information (surface, type of usage, ...) and to not use the measured values.

It was asked to split the notebook in two parts with:
- a notebook dedicated to the data analysis
- a notebook dedicated to the prediction

The dataset is available here:
