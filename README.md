List of the projects
1. Python's Discovery: Market Study with educational data from the World Bank
2. Initiation to Machine Learning: Predict the nutriment score of a food product
3. Supervised algorithms: CO2 emission and electricity consumption prediction of buildings in Seattle
4. Unsupervised algorithms: Customer segmentation of a e-Commerce Website
5. Deep Learning: Feasibility study of an article classification based on the article description and an image (front cover)
6. Scoring & Dashboard: implementing of a score methodology for e-commerce users
7. Cloud (AWS) & BigData

The project starts with the number 2, since the number 1 was about defining my goals for the DataScience program.
